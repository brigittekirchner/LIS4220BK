# LIS4220BK
These datasets were originally created and collected by Caroline Curwen from the University of Sheffield. They are also held in this Figshare repository: https://figshare.shef.ac.uk/articles/dataset/Synaesthesia_for_written_musical_keys/13140086/2.

These datasets were complied into this repository by Brigitte Kirchner, MLIS candidate at the University of Denver, for the LIS 4220: Data Curation class and final project. 

REPOSITORY CONTENTS:

File name: LIS 4220 combined profiles and additional information

Description: This is a write up combining the first two assignments from the class for this project, and additional information. The information included in this document are:
  The edited Metadata Profile assignment (including information on the project, the datasets, and metadata/data included in initial Figshare upload).
  The edited Repository Profile assignment (including information on which repository I would theoretically submit this to, reasoning why, any changes that would need to be done, and information included in SIP/DIP).
  Any additional comments for the final draft of this project including recommended data citation, considerations for long-term preservation, statement about the copyright license that would be appropriate, and considerations for human subject data.
  This is a .docx word document. 
  
  
 File name: Datasets
 
 Description: The files of the dataset in 3 different formats: .sav file format (as originally uploaded and analyzed in; this is a proprietary format created from the SPSS Stasticals V25 software), .xlsx file format (converted for me personally to open, as I don't have the software to open .sav files), and .csv file format (the preferred file format for the potential repository). Some unstructred metadata is included in these folders and files.

ADDITIONAL INFOMRATION:

  The website that I used to convert the original .sav files to .xlsx files can be found here: https://secure.ncounter.de/SpssConverter/Convert/SpssToExcel. Open source software also exists that can read .sav files, and one such software program, called JASP Stats, can be found here: https://jasp-stats.org/
