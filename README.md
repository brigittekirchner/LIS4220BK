# LIS4220BK
LIS 4220 Data Curation project

Included in this repository are:

  The edited Metadata Profile assignment (including information on the project, the datasets, and metadata/data included in initial Figshare upload).
  The edited Repository Profile assignment (including information on which repository I would theoretically submit this to, reasoning why, any changes that would need to be done, and information included in SIP/DIP).
  Any additional comments for the final draft of this project including recommended data citation, considerations for long-term preservation, statement about the copyright license that would be appropriate, and considerations for human subject data. The three parts will be combined into one .docx document.
  
  The files of the dataset in 3 different formats: .sav file format (as originally uploaded and analyzed in), .xlsx file format (converted for me personally to open, as I don't have the software to open .sav files), and .csv file format (the preferred file format for the potential repository). Some unstructred metadata is included in these folders and files.
  
  XML file of structured metadata in DataCite schema
