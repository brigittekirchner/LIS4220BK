A note on the naming convention and possible caveat:

First, I took the names of the files as they appeared from the creator, as seen in the naming of the .sav and .xlsx files. Each Excel workbook had three pages; .csv format, however
can only show one page at a time. Thus, I took the names from the Excel worksheets and saved those according to the names they had been given in the Excel workbook. The files with the
"-raw data" suffix are the data from each expirment or analyses; the files with the "-list variables" suffix have some metadata on how to interpret the raw data, and the "-source" suffix
are more metadata that usually gives a range for the values in the raw data. As the original .sav files were converted to .xlsx files through the online converter, coN'verter (which
can be found here: https://secure.ncounter.de/SpssConverter/Convert/SpssToExcel), I'm unclear on if these naming conventions are true to the researcher and data collector(s).
